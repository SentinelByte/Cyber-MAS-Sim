# 🛡️ Cyber MAS Sim

A lightweight simulation framework for modeling attacker and defender agents in a cybersecurity environment. Built from scratch to support reinforcement learning, automation, and cloud security training scenarios.


## 🚀 Features

- Simulated network with vulnerable nodes
- Attacker and defender agents with pluggable logic
- Logs, patching, and basic interaction tracking
- Designed for future expansion: RL, PettingZoo, AWS/K8s integrations

## 🧪 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SentinelByte/cyber-mas-sim.git
cd cyber-mas-sim
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2. Run the Simulation

```bash
python run.py
```

## ✅ TODO

* [ ] Add lateral movement and network graph
* [ ] Introduce Reinforcement Learning (PettingZoo/Gym)
* [ ] Model AWS or K8s-specific attack/defense behavior
* [ ] Visualization (grid or graph)

## ✅ Next Steps

Let me know if you’d like:

* A **public GitHub template repo** I can generate for you
* GitHub Actions to auto-run test simulations
* Integration with notebooks or Docker setup

Ready to push? I can help create the initial commit structure.
